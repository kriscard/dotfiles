## Choosing Your Terminal

### Use Kitty If:
- You need maximum compatibility with existing vim/tmux workflows
- You want extensive customization options and plugin ecosystem
- You use complex terminal applications that require specific features
- You prefer traditional split management without prefix keys
- You need the scrollback pager integration with Neovim

### Use Ghostty If:
- You prefer native macOS integration and system behaviors
- You want the fastest possible performance with minimal resource usage
- You like modern, minimal configuration with sensible defaults
- You're comfortable with tmux-style prefix key management
- You're on the latest macOS version and want cutting-edge features

## Font Requirements

Both terminals are configured to use **Hack Nerd Font Mono** which is automatically installed via the Brewfile. This ensures:
- Consistent appearance across terminals and applications
- Full icon/symbol support for modern CLI tools (eza, bat, etc.)
- Proper ligature rendering for enhanced code readability
- Complete Nerd Font icon range coverage

## Theme Consistency

Both terminals use Catppuccin themes and respect the `THEME_FLAVOUR` environment variable:
- **Macchiato**: Default dark theme (warm, cozy colors)
- **Mocha**: Darker alternative (deeper, richer colors)
- **Frappe**: Lighter dark theme (softer, muted colors)
- **Latte**: Light theme (clean, bright colors)

Change themes system-wide:
```bash
export THEME_FLAVOUR=macchiato  # or mocha, frappe, latte
```

## Performance Considerations

### Kitty
- Hardware-accelerated rendering for smooth scrolling
- Optimized font rendering with macOS-specific adjustments
- Remote control features for external tool integration
- Custom scrollback handling for large output

### Ghostty
- Native GPU acceleration with minimal overhead
- True native macOS integration for system-level optimizations
- Efficient memory usage and startup time
- Modern terminal standards for maximum compatibility

## Integration with Development Tools

Both terminals are optimized for the included development workflow:
- **Tmux**: Full compatibility with session management and plugins
- **Neovim**: Enhanced integration for editing and scrollback viewing
- **Modern CLI Tools**: Proper support for eza, bat, fd icons and colors
- **Git**: Enhanced diff and log viewing with syntax highlighting
- **Shell**: Fast startup and responsive interaction with zsh configuration

Choose based on your preference for native macOS integration (Ghostty) versus maximum customization and compatibility (Kitty).
