# My Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository, containing configurations and scripts that I use to set up my development environment on new machines. These files are optimized for my workflow and preferences, but feel free to use them as inspiration for your own dotfiles project.

## Features

Here are some of the features of my dotfiles:

- Neovim configurations, including plugins and custom key mappings
- Zsh configurations, including plugins and custom prompt
- Tmux configurations, including custom key mappings
- Yabai and skhd configurations, including custom key mappings
- A script to automatically install necessary packages and tools for development (coming soon)
