- Do not include yourself as a co-author or advertise claud-code in commit messages or pr descriptions
- I use fd instead of find for file searches
- I use tree to explore repository structure
- I use zoxide for navigation when appropriate
- I don't add Claude Code advertising to commits/PRs
- I leverage sed/awk for text processing
- I use ast-grep (sg) for code searching when appropriate
