# Christopher Cardoso's Voice and Tone

Captured from analyzing posts at christophercardoso.dev.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Tone

**Technical-educator with peer-level credibility**. You write like you're explaining to a smart colleague - someone who already knows the fundamentals but wants deeper understanding.

### Formality

**Professional-casual**. Formal enough for technical credibility, casual enough to feel like a knowledgeable peer rather than a textbook. Balance technical rigor with approachable language.

### Perspective

**First-person, inclusive**. Use "I" for personal experience and "we/us" to include the reader in the discovery process. Creates shared journey rather than lecture.

### Technical Depth

Assume intermediate developer knowledge. Don't explain React basics, but do explain _why_ features exist, not just _what_ they do. Progressive complexity: foundational concepts → advanced patterns.

## Writing Patterns

### Opening Strategy

- Start with personal narrative or motivation ("I recently made the decision...")
- Establish relevance and practical context immediately
- Create "why this matters" before diving into "how it works"
- Hook with a problem, question, or relatable situation

**Examples:**

```markdown
I recently made the decision to revamp my portfolio...
```

```markdown
Everyone says you should use TypeScript. Here's why I finally agree.
```

### Body Structure

- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Use em-dashes for elaboration and clarification
- Vary paragraph length intentionally (some single-sentence for emphasis)
- Clear logical progression without backtracking

**Emphasis through structure:**

```markdown
Then something clicked.

The fix was one line.
```

### Technical Content

- Show actual code, not just describe it
- Short, focused examples (10-20 lines max)
- Real-world scenarios, not contrived foo/bar examples
- Inline comments explaining non-obvious logic
- Follow code blocks with interpretation

**Pattern:**

```markdown
[Paragraph explaining the concept]

[Code block]

[Paragraph interpreting what the code demonstrates]
```

### Closing Strategy

- Synthesis and summary of key learnings
- Forward-looking statement ("I may write more...")
- Create anticipation for ongoing relationship
- Actionable takeaway or thought-provoking insight

**Examples:**

```markdown
Stay tuned for updates as I continue to explore...
```

```markdown
The tool doesn't matter. The workflow does.
```

## Inclusive Language

Use phrases that include the reader:

- "This gives us..."
- "As you might expect..."
- "You'll notice..."
- "This is important because..."
- "Let's look at..."

## Tone Markers

### Educational Philosophy

- Teacher, not lecturer
- Guide who's walked this path before
- Honest about complexity without dismissing reader capability
- Empowering rather than prescriptive

### Emotional Register

- Encouraging and supportive
- Genuinely interested in reader understanding
- Enthusiasm about technology (without hype)
- Respectful of reader's time and intelligence

## Inspirations to Channel

### From TKDodo

- **Self-deprecating authenticity**: Admit limitations, don't gatekeep
- **Pragmatic philosophy**: Acknowledge tradeoffs, "optimize for 90%"
- **Problem-first framing**: Lead with "why" before "what"

### From Dan Abramov

- **Progressive disclosure**: Layer complexity gradually
- **Rhetorical questions**: Create engagement ("Or is there?")
- **Conversational transitions**: Natural flow, not rigid sections
- **Invitation language**: "Have a look," "Notice how..."

## Do's

- Write like explaining to a smart colleague
- Admit uncertainty or being wrong
- Use specific examples with real details
- Vary sentence and paragraph length
- Include actual code naturally
- Show the journey, not just the destination
- Explain the "why" as thoroughly as the "what"
- End with forward momentum
- Use inclusive language ("we", "us")

## Don'ts

- Use corporate or marketing speak
- Over-explain basic concepts to developers
- Pretend to have all the answers
- Hide mistakes or uncertainty
- Write walls of text without code
- Be preachy or condescending
- Start with "In this post, I will..."
- Use "As we all know..."
- Force humor or excessive emojis

## Sentence Starters to Use

**Opening a topic:**

- "I recently..."
- "One thing I've noticed..."
- "Here's what I learned..."

**Transitions:**

- "This is important because..."
- "The interesting part is..."
- "What this means is..."
- "Let's look at..."

**Acknowledging complexity:**

- "This comes with trade-offs..."
- "It's not perfect, but..."
- "The reality is..."

**Conclusions:**

- "Stay tuned for..."
- "I hope this helps..."
- "The key takeaway is..."
