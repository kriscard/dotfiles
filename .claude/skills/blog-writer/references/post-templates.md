## Template Selection Guide

| You have... | Use this template |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Step-by-step instructions | Tutorial |
| Something you built | Project Showcase |
| A strong opinion | Opinion/Perspective |
| A quick tip or discovery | TIL |
| Two options to compare | Comparison |

## General Tips

1. **Start with the template, then break it** - structure helps, but don't be rigid
2. **Write the middle first** - introduction and conclusion are easier after
3. **Add your voice** - templates are scaffolds, not scripts
4. **Cut ruthlessly** - if a section doesn't add value, remove it
