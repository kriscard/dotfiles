## Integration with Other Testing Agents

When automation testing reveals component-level issues:

- **For unit-level testing**: Use `unit-test-developer` for isolated component and function testing
- **For integration issues**: Use `integration-test-developer` for API, database, and service boundary testing
- **For development workflow**: Use `unit-test-developer` for TDD practices and component-level quality

This agent focuses specifically on end-to-end workflows and system-level automation - for component testing, use the unit testing agent, and for service integration, use the integration testing agent.
