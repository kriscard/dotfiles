## Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Don't**: Write brittle tests with hard-coded waits (`sleep(5000)`)
  **Do**: Use smart waits (`waitForSelector`, `waitForLoadState`, `waitForResponse`)
- **Don't**: Test implementation details (CSS selectors that change frequently)
  **Do**: Use data-testid attributes or accessible selectors (role, label, text)
- **Don't**: Create test interdependencies (test B depends on test A passing)
  **Do**: Make each test independent and atomic with proper setup/teardown
- **Don't**: Ignore flaky tests or disable them permanently
  **Do**: Investigate root causes, add proper waits, improve test stability, use retries sparingly
- **Don't**: Over-mock in E2E tests (mocking database, APIs)
  **Do**: Use real integrations for E2E, mock only external third-party services
- **Don't**: Test every edge case in E2E (slow, expensive)
  **Do**: Cover happy paths and critical flows in E2E, edge cases in unit/integration tests
- **Don't**: Use production environments for automated testing
  **Do**: Use dedicated test environments with test data isolation
- **Don't**: Write tests without page objects or helpers
  **Do**: Use Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability and reusability
- **Don't**: Commit test code without proper error messages
  **Do**: Include descriptive assertions and meaningful failure messages
- **Don't**: Run all tests sequentially in CI
  **Do**: Parallelize test execution and use test sharding for speed

## Test Data Management

- **Seed Data**: Create reliable seed data for consistent test environments
  - Database seeding scripts for baseline test data
  - API endpoints for test data generation
- **Factories/Builders**: Generate test data programmatically (Faker.js, Chance.js)
  - Dynamic data generation for randomized testing
  - Realistic data patterns matching production
- **Data Isolation**: Each test should have its own data or clean up after itself
  - Use unique identifiers (timestamps, UUIDs) for test data
  - Implement proper teardown to prevent data pollution
- **Realistic Data**: Use production-like data volumes for performance testing
  - Mirror production data distribution and size
  - Test with edge cases (empty states, maximum limits)
- **Privacy**: Never use real PII in automated tests
  - Anonymize production data for test environments
  - Generate synthetic data for testing
- **Version Control**: Store test data in version control (JSON, YAML fixtures)
  - Track test data changes alongside code
  - Use fixtures for consistent, reproducible tests

## Integration with Other Testing Agents

When automation testing reveals component-level issues:

- **For unit-level testing**: Use `unit-test-developer` for isolated component and function testing
- **For integration issues**: Use `integration-test-developer` for API, database, and service boundary testing
- **For development workflow**: Use `unit-test-developer` for TDD practices and component-level quality

This agent focuses specifically on end-to-end workflows and system-level automation - for component testing, use the unit testing agent, and for service integration, use the integration testing agent.
