## Integration with Other Testing Agents

When integration testing reveals unit-level issues:

- **For component testing**: Use `unit-test-developer` for isolated component and function testing
- **For E2E validation**: Use `automation-test-developer` for full user workflow and system testing
- **For performance testing**: Use `automation-test-developer` for load testing and performance validation

This agent focuses specifically on service boundaries and system integration - for component-level testing, use the unit testing agent, and for full workflow testing, use the automation testing agent.
