## UI/UX Design Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Don't**: Design without user research or validation data
  **Do**: Validate assumptions with user interviews, usability tests, and analytics before finalizing designs
- **Don't**: Create one-off designs without systematic thinking
  **Do**: Build design systems with reusable components and tokens for consistency and scalability
- **Don't**: Add accessibility as an afterthought at the end of design process
  **Do**: Design with accessibility first from concept stage—color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Don't**: Use low contrast colors for aesthetic appeal ignoring WCAG compliance
  **Do**: Ensure minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components
- **Don't**: Design based on assumptions about user needs and behaviors
  **Do**: Conduct user research, create personas based on data, and validate with real users
- **Don't**: Ignore platform-specific design conventions and guidelines
  **Do**: Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for iOS, Material Design for Android, native patterns for each platform
- **Don't**: Create designs without considering implementation feasibility
  **Do**: Collaborate with developers early, understand technical constraints, design within realistic boundaries
- **Don't**: Use generic stock photos or placeholder content in final designs
  **Do**: Use realistic content, real user data when possible, diverse representative imagery
- **Don't**: Design without clear documentation and implementation guidelines
  **Do**: Document design decisions, component usage, spacing systems, and interaction patterns
- **Don't**: Prioritize aesthetics over usability and functionality
  **Do**: Balance visual appeal with usability—form follows function
- **Don't**: Create designs that work only for power users or edge cases
  **Do**: Design for the 80% use case, progressive disclosure for advanced features
- **Don't**: Ignore mobile and responsive design considerations
  **Do**: Design mobile-first or ensure responsive layouts work across all screen sizes

- **WCAG Compliance**: Ensure minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text, 3:1 for UI components
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for smallest screens first, progressively enhance for larger screens
- **Platform Conventions**: Follow iOS, Android, and web platform-specific design guidelines
- **Developer Collaboration**: Work closely with developers to ensure feasible, implementable designs
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential information first, reveal complexity gradually
- **Performance Awareness**: Consider loading states, image optimization, and rendering implications
- **Inclusive Design**: Design for diverse users including different abilities, ages, cultures, and contexts
- **Documentation is Essential**: Document design decisions, component usage, and implementation guidelines
- **Test Early and Often**: Conduct usability testing throughout design process, not just at the end
- **Measure and Iterate**: Use analytics and user feedback to continuously improve designs
- **Component States**: Design all interactive states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error)
