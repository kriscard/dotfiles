## Frontend Development Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Don't**: Use Client Components when Server Components would work
  **Do**: Default to Server Components, only use 'use client' when you need interactivity or browser APIs
- **Don't**: Fetch data in useEffect hooks unnecessarily
  **Do**: Use React Server Components, Server Actions, or proper data fetching libraries (React Query, SWR)
- **Don't**: Create prop drilling through multiple component layers
  **Do**: Use composition patterns, Context API, or state management libraries appropriately
- **Don't**: Mutate state directly or update state based on previous state incorrectly
  **Do**: Use functional state updates: `setState(prev => prev + 1)` instead of `setState(state + 1)`
- **Don't**: Overuse useMemo and useCallback everywhere "for performance"
  **Do**: Profile first, optimize only when needed; premature optimization causes complexity
- **Don't**: Use inline anonymous functions in JSX for event handlers in performance-critical components
  **Do**: Define handler functions outside render or use useCallback when passing to optimized child components
- **Don't**: Ignore accessibility (missing ARIA labels, poor keyboard navigation, no focus management)
  **Do**: Build accessible components from the start using semantic HTML and proper ARIA patterns
- **Don't**: Use `any` type in TypeScript or skip type definitions
  **Do**: Define proper TypeScript interfaces and types for props, state, and API responses
- **Don't**: Mix Server Actions with Client Component state management carelessly
  **Do**: Understand data flow between server and client, use proper form actions and progressive enhancement
- **Don't**: Skip error boundaries or ignore error states in components
  **Do**: Implement error boundaries for React errors and proper error UI for async operations
- **Don't**: Create massive components with hundreds of lines mixing logic and UI
  **Do**: Break down into smaller, focused components following single responsibility principle
- **Don't**: Ignore Core Web Vitals and performance budgets
  **Do**: Measure performance regularly, optimize images, implement code splitting, monitor bundle size

## Key Considerations

- **Server vs Client Components**: Default to Server Components for better performance; only use Client Components when you need interactivity, browser APIs, or hooks
- **Data Fetching Strategy**: Use Server Components for initial data, Server Actions for mutations, and client-side libraries (React Query, SWR) for interactive data
- **TypeScript First**: Write fully typed components with proper interfaces for props, state, and API responses
- **Accessibility from Start**: Build accessible components from the beginning, not as an afterthought; use semantic HTML and ARIA patterns
- **Performance Budgets**: Set and monitor performance budgets for bundle size, Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- **Error Handling**: Implement error boundaries for React errors, try-catch for async operations, and user-friendly error states
- **Loading States**: Provide loading UI with Suspense boundaries and skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Use Server Actions with forms to ensure functionality without JavaScript when possible
- **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based and component-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- **Image Optimization**: Always use Next.js Image component with proper width, height, and alt attributes
- **SEO & Meta Tags**: Implement proper metadata, Open Graph tags, and structured data for SSR/SSG pages
- **Third-Party Scripts**: Use Next.js Script component with appropriate loading strategies (beforeInteractive, afterInteractive, lazyOnload)
- **Testing Strategy**: Write component tests for behavior, integration tests for user flows, and E2E tests for critical paths
- **Component Documentation**: Document components with Storybook stories, TypeScript types, and usage examples for team collaboration

## When to Use MCP Tools

- **sequential-thinking**: Complex component architecture design requiring multi-step reasoning, analyzing performance optimization trade-offs, debugging complex React rendering issues, evaluating state management solutions, designing data fetching strategies across Server/Client Components
- **browsermcp**: Research React 19 documentation and new features, lookup Next.js 15+ App Router patterns, find accessibility best practices and ARIA examples, investigate CSS framework documentation (Tailwind, shadcn/ui), check Core Web Vitals optimization techniques, research third-party library integration (NextAuth, Stripe, Vercel AI SDK)
- **context7**: Fetch latest documentation for React ecosystem libraries (React Query, Zustand, Jotai), retrieve Next.js API reference and examples, lookup styling library documentation (Tailwind, styled-components, Framer Motion), find authentication library docs (NextAuth.js, Lucia, Supabase), retrieve Vercel AI SDK streaming patterns, get database integration docs (Prisma, Drizzle)
- **playwright**: Test React components in real browser environment, validate responsive design across viewport sizes, debug client-side JavaScript errors visually, test form submissions and Server Actions, validate accessibility with browser tools, debug CSS layout and styling issues, test third-party integrations (OAuth flows, payment forms), perform visual regression testing for components
- **shadcn**: Browse and implement shadcn/ui components for rapid UI development, find accessible component examples (dialogs, dropdowns, forms), integrate pre-built components with Tailwind CSS, customize shadcn components for design system, implement form components with validation, add command palettes and search interfaces, build dashboard layouts and data tables
